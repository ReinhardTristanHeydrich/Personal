# Personal

This repository contains personal configuration files, customizations, and backups that I’ve decided to keep public. It serves as a central place for storing and versioning things that I use frequently across devices or just want to keep handy.

### What's in here?

- **Discord CustomCSS**: My personal Discord style tweaks using CustomCSS (for client mods like Vencord or Powercord).
- **VS Codium Settings**: Settings and extensions in JSON format that reflect my preferred development environment.

### Can I use this?

Sure! Feel free to browse, copy, fork, or adapt anything here to your own needs. Just be mindful that these files are made for my personal use, so they may not suit everyone out of the box — but you're welcome to tweak them however you like.
